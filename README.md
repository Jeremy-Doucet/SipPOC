# Sip POC

This is a proof of concept for being able to stream a static video through the server for a SIP call using the Vonage Video API.

## Notes

- Disable/enable the dev skill in the alexa app to refresh the URI and token
- Make a call to callcenter (alexa, get me a doctor)
- Press the "call member" button
